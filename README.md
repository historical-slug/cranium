Making a history publication site. Basically, this project is meant for students, mainly those attending UC Santa Cruz, to have a home to publish their historical research. Currently, Santa Cruz lacks a place for history majors to develop their research skills in terms of a publication service. That is where this project comes in. The goal is to house publications and contributor information to expose students' work to those who view it.
